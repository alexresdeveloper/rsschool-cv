 I want to be a front-end developer. Now I'm studying CSS, HTML, JS for this purpose. It the main goal for me. <br>
 * Some words about Me:
    *  I am _flexible_ in my working hours, being able to work evenings and weekends;
    *  I am always _energetic_ and _eager_ to learn new skills;
    *  I use a _creative_ approach to problem solve;
    *  I am _able_ to handle multiple tasks on a daily basis.
    
 I have basic skills in: JS, CSS, HTML, Git and every day I'am improving thats. <br>
 I did a curse in HTML academy: basic __CSS/HTML/JS__. <br>
 My English isnâ€™t that good, if believe some tests, only A2, but I with it not finish yet. *I can always do better*=).
